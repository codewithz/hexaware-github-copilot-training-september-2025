# Training Roadmap: GitHub Copilot Hands-On

Welcome to the training repository! This page will guide you on how our learning journey will proceed and how each folder in this repo connects to your practice.

---

## 1. Start with Core Content
We will begin with a **training PDF** that explains GitHub Copilot fundamentals:
- What Copilot is, how it works.
- How to interact in **inline** vs **chat** mode.
- Best practices for prompting.

This will serve as your **reference document** throughout the training.

---

## 2. Resources 📚
The **`resources/`** folder will be continuously updated with:
- **Cheat sheets** for quick Copilot usage.
- **Reference pages** for Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and testing automation.
- **Extra reading materials** (official docs, blog posts, curated guides).

👉 Think of this as your *Copilot library*—check back often as new materials will be added during the training.

---

## 3. Small Practice Tasks 🎯
In the **`task1/`** and **`task2/`** folders, you will find **bite-sized tasks**.  
These are designed to:
- Get you familiar with Copilot features step by step.
- Practice writing effective prompts.
- See how Copilot behaves in different contexts.

Examples:  
- Generate a helper function with comments.  
- Add unit tests using the **AAA** pattern.  
- Suggest refactoring for cleaner code.  

These are warm-up exercises to build confidence.

## 4. Challenges 🏆
Once you’re comfortable, we move to the **`challenges/`** folder.  
Here you will find **7 hands-on challenges** designed to simulate real work:

1. Add a **README.md** file.  
2. Write a **test file** with proper structure.  
3. Fix a given **issue** in the code.  
4. Generate a new **component** (Angular or Spring).  
5. Convert a project from one **build tool** to another (Gradle → Maven).  
6. Refactor/translate a small **codebase to another language**.  
7. Add improvements or missing documentation.  

👉 These challenges are meant to push you beyond basic prompts and test how you adapt Copilot to real developer workflows.

---

## 5. Final Task 🚀
Finally, in the **`final-task/`** folder, you will find a **capstone project**.  
This is a larger assignment where you will:
- Apply everything you learned (prompting, testing, refactoring, generation).  
- Work more independently with Copilot guiding your coding.  
- Demonstrate practical mastery of Copilot in a real-world scenario.

---

## 6. How It All Comes Together
The flow of training will be:
1. **Understand concepts** → from PDF and live demos.  
2. **Practice basics** → through tasks in `task1/` and `task2/`.  
3. **Level up with challenges** → complete progressively harder exercises.  
4. **Apply in final project** → integrate everything into a practical build.  

By the end, you’ll not only know how to use Copilot, but also when to rely on it, when to correct it, and how to make it an effective partner in your development workflow.

✅ **Tip**: Keep track of what worked and what didn’t in your prompts—this will help you refine your personal **Prompt Bank** during the course.
