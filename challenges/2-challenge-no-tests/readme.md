# Upgrade Required

## Introduction

This folder contains a Java Spring Boot application that has no unit tests! Who can believe it possible in this day and age?

The application requires you to create some unit tests.

## The Challenge

There are no tests at all so you will be starting from scratch. Create as many suitable unit tests as you think are necessary to ensure that the code is working well and that the test coverage is to a level that would be acceptable for a production application.

If you are running out of time, create as many tests as you can. You will get points for the tests that you create.
