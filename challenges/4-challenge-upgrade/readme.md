# Upgrade Required

## Introduction

This folder contains a Java Spring Boot application that was last updated in 2021. The version of Java currently in use is outdated, and the version of SpringBoot is similarly outdated.

This application needs to be upgraded to the latest versions of both Java and SpringBoot.

## The Challenge

The Java SpringBoot application is a basic REST API. It connects to a MySQL database. The SQL script for the database is in the `sql` folder. You are more than welcome to run it. You might need to change the database username and password to match your MySQL configuration.

Note that the upgrade process is not as simple as changing a few entries in the pom.xml file! Having said that, you will not need to make many code changes, and the upgrade process should be relatively straightforward. If it is getting messy, you are probably on the wrong track.
