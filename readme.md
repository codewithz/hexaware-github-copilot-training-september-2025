# Training Roadmap: GitHub Copilot Hands-On

Welcome to the training repository! This page will guide you on how our learning journey will proceed and how each folder in this repo connects to your practice.

---

## 1. Start with Core Content 📖
We will begin with a training PDF that explains GitHub Copilot fundamentals:

- What Copilot is, how it works.  
- How to interact in **inline** vs **chat** mode.  
- Best practices for prompting.  

👉 This will serve as your reference document throughout the training.

---

## 2. Resources 📚
The `resources/` folder will be continuously updated with **quick reading materials** to support your learning journey:

- **Cheat sheets** for quick Copilot usage.  
- **Reference guides** for Java, Spring Boot, Angular, Testing Automation.  
- **Extra reading materials** (official docs, blog posts, curated guides).  
- **Quick reads** for on-the-go refreshers.  

👉 Think of this as your **Copilot library**—check back often as new materials will be added during the training.  
Whenever you need theory or examples, this folder is your first stop.

---

## 3. Small Practice Tasks 🎯
In the `tasks/` folder, you will find bite-sized tasks.  
These are designed to:

- Get you familiar with Copilot features step by step.  
- Practice writing effective prompts.  
- See how Copilot behaves in different contexts.  

Examples:  
- Generate a helper function with comments.  
- Add unit tests using the **AAA pattern**.  
- Suggest refactoring for cleaner code.  

👉 These are warm-up exercises to build confidence.

---

## 4. Challenges 🏆
Once you’re comfortable, we move to the `challenges/` folder.  
Here you will find **hands-on coding challenges** that simulate real work:

- Add a README.md file.  
- Write a test file with proper structure.  
- Fix a given issue in the code.  
- Generate a new component (Angular or Spring).  
- Convert a project from one build tool to another (Gradle → Maven).  
- Refactor/translate a small codebase to another language.  
- Add improvements or missing documentation.  

👉 These challenges push you beyond basics and test how you adapt Copilot to real workflows.

---

## 5. Final Task 🚀
Finally, in the `final-task/` folder, you will find a **capstone project**.  
This is a larger assignment where you will:

- Apply everything you learned (prompting, testing, refactoring, generation).  
- Work more independently with Copilot guiding your coding.  
- Demonstrate practical mastery of Copilot in a real-world scenario.  

---

## 6. How It All Comes Together 🛠
The flow of training will be:

1. **Understand concepts** → from PDF and live demos.  
2. **Practice basics** → through tasks in `tasks/`.  
3. **Level up with challenges** → progressively harder exercises.  
4. **Apply in final project** → integrate everything into a practical build.  

By the end, you’ll not only know **how** to use Copilot, but also **when** to rely on it, when to correct it, and how to make it an effective partner in your workflow.

✅ **Tip:** Keep track of what worked and what didn’t in your prompts—this will help you refine your personal **Prompt Bank** during the course.
